SYNOPSIS
        ./script/myapp_create.pl HTML::FormHandler::Scripts

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Catalyst helper module that builds a HTML::FormHandler form
    for you, from your DBIx::Class schema, using
    HTML::FormHandler::Model::DBIC.

    VERY EARLY CODE: things may yet change, but shouldn't impact older
    versions (unless you regenerate the script).

    The generated script depends on: HTML::FormHandler::Generator::DBIC,
    Config::JFDI, opts, aliased.

SEE ALSO
    DBIx::Class, HTML::FormHandler, HTML::FormHandler::Model::DBIC.
